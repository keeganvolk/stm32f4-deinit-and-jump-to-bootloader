The STM modules come with a boot partition that can use different protocols, including CAN.
Information about bootloading over CAN can be found here:

I have written code that deinitializes the module (because deinitialization is required to jump to a new memory partition) and jumps to the bootloader.
The an2606 PDF has information about the bootloader, and the an3254 PDF has information about the CAN protocol used in the bootloader.

The next step would be to add a custom CAN command to execute the code I have written to jump to the bootloader.
